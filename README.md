# R_Excel_UI

## Purpose ##
The purpose of these files is to enable those who have little to no experience with statistical programming to run powerful predictive algorithms using Excel as the UI. While working as an Analytics intern during grad school, one of my projects was to build out Excel Spreadsheets with customized capabilities. It was a blast, so I've decided to continue building my own R enabled Workbooks in my spare time.

## Functionality ##

The current functionality of this project consists of fitting up to 10 popular Supervised Learning Models on any given dataset, producing the AUC ROC for each model, and producing predictions for new data, all within a single Excel Macro-Enabled Workbook.

## Future Direction ##
As is, this project is great for quickly fitting several predictive models and benchmarking the typical predictive capabilities available. Many of these models can be greatly improved by parameter tuning, model optimization, and data visualization. Moving foward, I plan to add additional functionality and several more customizable parameters to better understand the relationships within the data and maximize the model's predictive accuracy.
